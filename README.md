# On-Exploring-Indeterminate-Relationships-for-Visual-Relationship-Detection

We provide codes for On Exploring Undetermined Relationships for Visual Relationship Detectionï¼Œ CVPR2019.

The codes include three parts: codes of Faster R-CNN for object detection, codes of relationship generator for undetermined relationships, and codes of relationship predictor for relationship detection.

We will provide the Pytorch codes as soon as possible. 

The end-to-end version of codes will be released in our future work.

We have provided the predicate and the rela files for VRD.

We are still missing some datasets and .ckpt files, since they are too huge to be uploaded. 

We are still fixing some bugs.

We will write a readme file for using this code.
